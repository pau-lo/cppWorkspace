/*      Controlling Program Flow
 * 
 *      - Sequence
 *          * ordering statements sequentially
 *       
 *      - Selection
 *          * Making decisions
 * 
 *              if statements 
 *              if-else statement 
 *              Nested if statements 
 *              switch statement 
 *              Conditional operator ?
 * 
 *      - Iteration
 *          * Looping or reapeating
 * 
 *              for loop 
 *              Range-based for loop
 *              while loop
 *              do-while loop
 *              infinite loop
 *              nested loops (lopps within loops)
 * 
 * 
 *      With these threes we can implement any algorithm
